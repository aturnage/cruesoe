                <p class="faqQuestion">What is Sex Therapy?</p>
                <p class="faqAnswer">As defined by the Mayo Clinic, “Sex therapy is a type of psychotherapy — a general term for treating mental health problems by talking with a mental health professional. Through sex therapy, you can address concerns about sexual function, sexual feelings and intimacy, either in individual therapy or in joint therapy with your partner. Sex therapy can be effective for individuals of any age, sex or sexual orientation.</p>
                <p class="faqAnswer">Sex therapy is usually provided by psychologists, social workers, physicians or licensed therapists who have special training in issues related to sex and relationships. Certified sex therapists have graduate degrees and can demonstrate their competence in sex therapy by becoming credentialed by the American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors and Therapists (AASECT).</p>
                <p class="faqAnswer"><em><strong>Certified sex therapists do not have sexual contact with clients, in the office or anywhere else. Sexual coaching that involves physical contact is not part of mainstream sex therapy.</strong></em></p>
                <p class="faqAnswer">Sex therapy is usually short term, with a limited number of sessions. The treatment plan depends on the concerns to be addressed.”</p>
                <p class="faqQuestion">What is sexuality education?</p>
                <p class="faqAnswer">As defined by The Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States (SIECUS), sexuality education is defined as, “a lifelong process of acquiring information and forming attitudes, beliefs, and values. It encompasses sexual development, sexual and reproductive health, interpersonal relationships, affection, intimacy, body image, and gender roles.”</p>
                <p class="faqQuestion">Do you accept insurance?</p>
                <p class="faqAnswer">Some insurance is accepted. Please contact your health plan to verify if I am a paneled provider. If you are not a member of a health plan that I accept, private pay options are available. Sliding scale options may be available. Currently, I accept: </p>

                </ul>
                <p class="faqQuestion">How long will I be in therapy</p>
                <p class="faqAnswer">Therapeutic issues are varied in time commitment. A large part of your success is your responsibility, and is reflected in your commitment to treatment. Typically, sessions last 50 minutes, once per week. Based on your needs, variance to this can be discussed. Please be aware that varied options are often governed by your insurance company, if permitted at all. Any non-covered services will be the responsibility of the client and will be expected to be paid at the time of services</p>
